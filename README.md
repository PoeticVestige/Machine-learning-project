# This is an attempt by a newcomer to machine learning
## First Project
In the first project, I tried the following:
- Predict the activation energy of biomass pyrolysis using 281 samples.
- Used SVM, LinearRegression, RF, XGBoost, GBDT, etc.
- Tried blending model fusion method.
- We simply built a neural network in pytorch for regression tasks.
-  Provides some examples of data visualization
- Because the amount of data is relatively small, so, use some opportunistic ways to generate some data. Even though it's wrong, this is just an example to train myself.

Considering my limited expertise, this case study is humbly presented to inspire more valuable insights.
